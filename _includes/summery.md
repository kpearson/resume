<p>I am currently the Director of Engineering at SamCart, building and leading
cross-functional teams committed to helping creators sell and market their
content to the world.</p>

<p>Prior to SamCart, I worked at National CineMedia for 2 years (2018-2020), where
I was promoted to Engineering Manager of Noovie.com, the digital companion to
the Noovie preshow in movie theatres across the country. My team built a
content publishing platform that consistently led to Noovie content rising to
the first page of Google search results for high-value keywords.</p>

<p>Between 2017 and 2018 I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Cyndx, an early
stage startup. As a full stack engineer, I contributed to every aspect of the
companyâ€™s product, including the application code, designing and building the
cloud infrastructure that powers the Cyndx machine learning engine, and leading
the data engineering practice.</p>
