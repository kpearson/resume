EXPERIENCE
----------

#### [Cyndx Networks] | Lead Data Engineer, Los Angeles, CA 2017 - Present
Established the data engineering team at Cyndx, with the mandate to develop
production-ready data systems. These systems focus on delivering the result of
machine learning algorithms to end users, model training, and data ingestion.

During my time leading the data engineering team, we met several critical
milestones. Working closely with product, data science, and application teams, I
identified short term requirements. We were then able to build and deploy
interim solutions. At the same time designing and developing long-term solutions
to deliver performant machine learning algorithms, and automated data ingestion
pipelines.

The data engineering team is a cross-functional team with advanced skills
developed around delivering data-centric applications. We're well versed in
application development, data science, and DevOps, allowing for rapid
development of fast, fault-tolerant services in our application ecosystem.
