Resume in HTML
==============

This repo is a very simple about me. One or two pages hosted on Github pages
and built with Jekyll. At the moment I only plan on a single page containing my
Resume.

The goal is a Resume in markdown displayed in HTML and easily output to PDF.
Initially I'm planing on two slightly different versions of the css. One to
style the HTML and the other to style the PDF render.
